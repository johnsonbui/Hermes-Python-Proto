# Simple Idea

# Grab text samples 
# Create bigrams / trigrams from the samples
# Pass the bigrams / trigrams to the neuNet
# Generates weights and learn new pairs

# Have the neuNet compare against query
# Which generates likely pairs and passes possible solutions to the sentence generator


# Problems 
# Grammar is not dynamic, only static
# Must have Markov chain or decision tree assess prob of grammar values 
# And generate grammar structure
